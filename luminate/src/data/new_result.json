He stood in the clearing in disbelief, pondering what it all meant. As he returned to the village, he was grateful but also felt a great sadness for the fox. Perhaps it was loneliness that drove it to act so erratically. \n\nAs James settled back into the warmth of his bed that night, he realized that he had been gifted a second chance at life.
